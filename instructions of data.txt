This file contains data used in 'Automatic identification of microseismic and blasting signals using Random Forest method' in GRL
All data in the form of '.mat' can be opened in matlab

File SVD contains the singular values of time-frequecny spectrum of 500 signals. 
singular1 to singular250 are the results of MS signals. 
singular251 to singular500 are the results of Blasting signals.
singular1 to singular200 and singular251 to singular450 are results of signals in training set of RF.
singular201 to singular250 and singular451 to singular500 are results of signals in testing set of RF.

input_ML.mat is a 500*105 matrix.
each row of input_ML.mat is the 105 features of corresponding singular values of signals in 'File SVD'
row1 to row250 are the results of MS signals. 
row251 to row500 are the results of Blasting signals.
row1 to row200 and row251 to row450 are results of signals in training set of RF.
row201 to row250 and row451 to row500 are results of signals in testing set of RF.
