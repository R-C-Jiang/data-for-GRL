This file contains data used in 'Automatic identification of microseismic and blasting signals using Random Forest method' in GRL
All data in the form of '.mat' can be opened in matlab

File TF contains the time-frequecny results of the improved HHT for 500 signals. 
TF1 to TF250 are the results of MS signals. 
TF251 to TF500 are the results of Blasting signals.
TF1 to TF200 and TF251 to TF450 are results of signals in training set of RF.
TF201 to TF250 and TF451 to TF500 are results of signals in testing set of RF.

File SVD contains the singular values of time-frequecny spectrum of 500 signals in File TF. 
singular1 to singular250 are the results of MS signals. 
singular251 to singular500 are the results of Blasting signals.
singular1 to singular200 and singular251 to singular450 are results of signals in training set of RF.
